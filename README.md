# Capstone-Project

This project was completed as a capstone for the avionics class of 2019. The data collected and used to model the drone is unique to the drone and is not included in this repository. However you can contact me with any questions as its fairly simple to understand the data consisting of voltage and corosponding sensor values.

This project was done in a group of 5, i have included the code for the controller design that i myself conpleted along with the other files consisting of my colleges work on the GUI and various other parts of the project.
