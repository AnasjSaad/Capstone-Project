# Capstone-Project

This project was completed as a capstone for the avionics class of 2019. 

I included an excel file of the motor data used to design the controller which was first collected by running tests on the drone for each axis individually. This data was then used to create the individuaa open-loop transfer functions for each axis which was then used to build the controller. 


Unfortuantely I cannot share the code for the full process of design as this is an ongoing capstone projects for the Avionics department at Ryerson University but you can contact me for any questions regarding the codes, and data file attached!
