# Capstone-Project

This project was completed as a capstone for the avionics class of 2019. I included an excel file of the motor data used to design the controller, as well as the MATLAB code used to design the transfer functions for the controller design that utilizes that data.

As a bonus I have inclduded a pdf section of my final Capstone report that diplays the simulink model along with the mission profile code used on the project. I have took the step of not including the code files for safety of plagirism for the avionics students that come following my year.

You can contact me for any questions regarding the codes, and data file attached.
